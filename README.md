# Shiny App

## Summary
I'm developing an interactive data visualization tool by Shiny for the business portfolio analytics purpose. 
For CRM use: https://holly.shinyapps.io/MIS_CRM

## Features
- [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) enables audience to visualize the data and graphs interactively.
- Password needed to login the app and I encrypt the password with javascript `md5` as instructed by [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28987622/starting-shiny-app-after-password-input).

- It's almost all based on R which means I can use my favorite plotting packages such as `ggplot2` freely!


## TO DO
- Add analytical reports for people in different levels, GL, ML, VP etc....

## Statement
This project is mostly done during off-work hours, like evenings and weekends. Ideas represented here are my own and do not represent the views of any company or organization.
