# Shiny App

## Summary
I'm developing an interactive data visualization tool by Shiny for the business portfolio analytics purpose. 

## Features
- [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) enables audience to visualize the data and graphs interactively.
- Password needed to login the app and I encrypt the password with javascript `md5` as instructed by [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28987622/starting-shiny-app-after-password-input).
- It's almost all based on R which means I can use my favorite plotting packages such as `ggplot2` freely!
